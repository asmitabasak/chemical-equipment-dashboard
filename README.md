# ⚗️ Chemical Equipment Management System

A high-performance analytics dashboard designed to monitor and manage chemical processing equipment. This project uses a **Django** backend to process sensor data and **Chart.js** to visualize pressure, temperature, and flowrates.

## 📊 Project Overview
* **Interactive Analytics**: Automatically calculates Total Equipment, Average Temperature (71.1°C), and Max Pressure (110.8 bar) from uploaded datasets.
* **Visualizations**: Includes Bar charts for Temperature Distribution, Line charts for Pressure Levels, and Pie charts for Equipment Type Distribution.
* **Data Management**: Features search filters, data reset options, and an export function for reporting.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Backend**: Django, Django Rest Framework, Pandas (for CSV parsing).
* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js.
* **Environment**: Managed via Python Virtual Environment (`.venv`).
